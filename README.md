Code Stream is a web-based, real-time collaborative code editor built for on-the-fly pair programming sessions and technical interviews. It requires **no user accounts or data storage**. Simply create a room, share the URL, and start coding. All session data is ephemeral, held in memory, and completely wiped when the last person leaves the room.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### 1. Prerequisites
* You must have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
* You need a **RapidAPI** account with a subscription to the free **Judge0** API plan.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VeDaNsH-D/CodeStream.git
cd CodeStream
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
This installs all packages required for the server and the build process.

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.

Add your RapidAPI key to this file. Remember to use `API_KEY` as the variable name.
```
API_KEY=your_actual_rapidapi_key_here
```

### 5. Build the Frontend
This command minifies the frontend JavaScript, preparing it for use.

```bash
npm run build
```

### 6. Run the Application
Start the local server.

```bash
npm start
```
Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Note:** For full video/audio functionality locally, you may need to set up a self-signed SSL certificate and run the server over HTTPS, as browsers have strict security policies. The feature is guaranteed to work on a deployed `https://` URL.

## Deployment
This app is configured for easy deployment on a platform like Render.

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Ensure your complete project is in a GitHub repository.
2.  **Create a "Web Service" on Render:** Connect your GitHub repo.
3.  **Use the following settings:**
    *   **Build Command:** `npm install && npm run build`
    *   **Start Command:** `npm start`
4.  **Add Environment Variable:** In the **Environment** tab, set a variable with the **Key** `API_KEY` and your RapidAPI key as the **Value**.

Render will automatically deploy your application and provide a live `https://` URL.
